## Programming III CI6110 Worksheet 6 2018-19
This tests out a basic GitHub FLow beginning at the Worksheet6 Starting Code v1
It also uses [markdown] (https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/blob/master/doc/user/markdown.md)

The GitHub Flow begins with version 1 of the starting code

Branches will occur for modifications to the starting code and for solutions to each question

It maybe that GItHub FLow is not suitable for this as there may need to be a Starting Code Branch and a Solution Code branch
